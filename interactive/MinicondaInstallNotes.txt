I downloaded Miniconda from the miniconda website and ran it:

wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

I gave the /opt/export/course/pygpu/miniconda path, and answered no when
it wanted me to set up the conda command. This was the outbput message:

    You have chosen to not have conda modify your shell scripts at all.
    To activate conda's base environment in your current shell session:
    
    eval "$(/opt/export/course/pygpu/miniconda/bin/conda shell.YOUR_SHELL_NAME hook)"
    
    To install conda's shell functions for easier access, first activate, then:
    
    conda init
    
    If you'd prefer that conda's base environment not be activated on startup,
       set the auto_activate_base parameter to false:
    
    conda config --set auto_activate_base false
    
    Thank you for installing Miniconda3!


I also installed jupyter labextension install @ijmbarr/jupyterlab_spellchecker.

Part 2: reinstall

This time, we'll use mambaforge (miniforge) to speed things up:

wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh

Same answers as above. This gave Python 3.9.

Since activating the environment doesn't really give a working "conda" command anymore, I used:



Though, mamba actually works, so not really needed. Then I added the environment module. I had
to update the environment "base" since that's what we tie to. :/
