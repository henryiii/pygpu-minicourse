# I downloaded Miniconda from the miniconda website (now Mambaforge) and ran it:

# wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh

chmod +x Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh


# I gave the /opt/export/course/pygpu/miniconda path, and answered no when
# it wanted me to set up the conda command.

eval "$(/opt/export/course/pygpu/miniconda/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"

mamba env update -f environment.yml -n base

jupyter labextension install @ijmbarr/jupyterlab_spellchecker

# Then I added the environment module. I had
# to update the environment "base" since that's what we tie to. :/
