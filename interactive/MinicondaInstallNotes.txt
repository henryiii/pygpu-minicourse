I downloaded Miniconda from the miniconda website and ran it:

wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

I gave the /opt/export/course/pygpu/miniconda path, and answered no when
it wanted me to set up the conda command. This was the outbput message:

    You have chosen to not have conda modify your shell scripts at all.
    To activate conda's base environment in your current shell session:
    
    eval "$(/opt/export/course/pygpu/miniconda/bin/conda shell.YOUR_SHELL_NAME hook)"
    
    To install conda's shell functions for easier access, first activate, then:
    
    conda init
    
    If you'd prefer that conda's base environment not be activated on startup,
       set the auto_activate_base parameter to false:
    
    conda config --set auto_activate_base false
    
    Thank you for installing Miniconda3!
